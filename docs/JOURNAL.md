# locveil-satellite — journal (newest on top)

Dated record of work done; rotates per `ledger-discipline.md` §2 (whole days into
`docs/archive/journal/`, pointer here).

## 2026-07-12 — design corpus + provisioning plane imported from locveil-voice (BUILD-22)

Plain moves, frozen history stays in voice (`git -C ../locveil-voice log --follow` for
pre-move history). Landed: `docs/design/esp32_satellite.md` (the authoritative ARCH-22
consolidated design; §4.1–4.3 wire tables demoted to a pointer at voice's
`websocket-api.md` + the `contracts/` pin, per the PROD-15 delegation),
`docs/design/ws_esp32_transport.md` (superseded lineage, frozen),
`docs/architecture/esp32.md` + `docs/images/esp32-{fit,turn}.{dot,png}` (cross-repo links
re-pointed), and the **Plane-B fleet-provisioning tree** voice `nginx/` → `provisioning/`
(D-6-as-amended; ansible playbook + CA/provisioning scripts + nginx site template; the
operator-local `inventory.ini`/`group_vars/all.yml` copied on disk and gitignored here —
the WB7 deployment itself is untouched, this is a repo-side handover). Voice keeps a
pinned copy of `esp32-site.conf.j2` for its TLS-e2e test (its tether; re-pin direction is
voice-pulls-from-here). Imported tasks: **DES-5** (ex voice ARCH-44, cert lifecycle) +
**FW-1** (ex voice ARCH-23, firmware build — reconcile at start, HK-4 amendments noted
inline). Interim WS-protocol pin recorded in `contracts/README.md`.

## 2026-07-12 — repo bootstrapped from process/new-repo-template

Instantiated by voice **BUILD-22** (board **PROD-15**, council HK-4) from
`../locveil-commons/process/new-repo-template/` at **scope-v3** — CLAUDE.md with the two
pinned shared blocks + the repo-local LAW (esp32-only-charter, phase-gates, hw-gated,
per-device-tags, per-device-apps, consumer-pins, no-execution-toolchain-at-bootstrap),
ledger triad, vendored `scripts/scope_guard.py` @ scope-v3, pre-commit hook
(`core.hooksPath hooks`), `ledger-guard` CI. Skeleton directories: `components/`,
`boards/`, `provisioning/`, `contracts/`. Born backlog DES-1..DES-4 + OPS-1..OPS-2 seeded
from the PROD-15 entry. No deviations from the template.
